                    <p>1h9- County Code (Section 13-264, Section 13-265 & Section 13-267) <ul>
                        <li> Sec. 13-264. - Weed height.
                        It shall be the duty of every person as owner, occupant, lessee, or agent in charge of land lying in any
                        subdivision within the unincorporated areas of the County, except as otherwise provided in Section 13-262, to
                        keep all weeds, as defined, cut to a height of not over twelve (12) inches on lots of one (1) acre or less;
                        provided, however, that when a parcel of land, whether subdivided or not, is contiguous to a developed lot,
                        plot, site, or tract of one (1) acre or less then, and in such event, the provisions hereof shall apply for a distance
                        of fifty (50) feet equidistant from the common boundary line. </li> 
                         <li> Sec. 13-265. - Accumulation or deposit of litter prohibited.
                        It shall be the duty of every person as owner, occupant, lessee, or agent in charge of land lying within the
                        unincorporated areas of the County, except as otherwise provided in Section 13-262, to prevent litter,
                        garbage, rubbish, and refuse from accumulating, either temporarily or permanently, on such land. The
                        owner of improved property which is used for commercial or industrial purposes shall remove all
                        garbage and rubbish from both the paved and unpaved public areas and empty the receptacle into an
                        approved container in accordance with Section 13-234. This Section shall not apply to those activities
                        otherwise allowable under Subtitle 21 of this Code, and shall not apply to those persons who store litter
                        in private receptacles for collection, or under controlled conditions for industrial processing, such as
                        recycling. </li>
                        <li> Sec. 13-267. - Action upon noncompliance.
                        It shall be the responsibility of any owner or responsible person duly notified to properly dispose of litter
                        or weeds, or both, within ten (10) calendar days after certified mailing of written notice provided for in Section
                        13-266, above, or within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of written notice when personal service is
                        effected, or within ten (10) calendar days after physical posting of the property, and so notify the Director. If
                        the violation is not corrected within such time period, the Director shall issue a civil monetary fine in
                        accordance with Section 13-271. The Director is also hereby authorized and empowered to defray the costs of
                        disposing of such litter or weeds, or both, by contract, or to order its disposal by County personnel. The
                        property owner shall be notified of the charges for disposal, in the manner prescribed by Section 13-266, and
                        shall have thirty (30) days to pay. </li> </ul>
